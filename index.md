# RTMBdist — AD distribution library ![](reference/figures/RTMBdist_hex.png)

The [`RTMB`](https://kaskr.r-universe.dev/RTMB) package enables powerful
and flexible statistical modelling with rich random effect structures
using automatic differentiation (AD). However, its built-in support for
probability distributions is limited to standard cases. `RTMBdist` fills
this gap by providing a collection of non-standard, AD-compatible
distributions, extending the range of models that can be implemented and
estimated with `RTMB`. Most of the distributions implemented in
`RTMBdist` allow for automatic simulation and residual calculation by
`RTMB`.

The full list of distributions currently available is given in the [List
of
distributions](https://janoleko.github.io/RTMBdist/articles/distlist.html)
vignette. There are also a couple of [Worked
examples](https://janoleko.github.io/RTMBdist/articles/Examples.html)
demonstrating how to use `RTMBdist` in practice.

distribution!

## Installation

You can install the released version from
[CRAN](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=RTMBdist) with:

``` r
install.packages("RTMBdist")
```

or the development version from
[GitHub](https://github.com/janoleko/RTMBdist) with:

``` r
remotes::install_github("janoleko/RTMBdist")
```

## Introductory example

``` r
library(RTMBdist)
```

Let’s do numerical maximum likelihood estimation with a `gumbel`
distribution:

``` r
# simulate data
x <- rgumbel(100, location = 5, scale = 2)

# negative log-likelihood function
nll <- function(par) {
  x <- OBS(x) # mark x as the response
  loc <- par[1]; ADREPORT(loc)
  scale <- exp(par[2]); ADREPORT(scale)
  -sum(dgumbel(x, loc, scale, log = TRUE))
}

# RTMB AD object
obj <- MakeADFun(nll, c(5, log(2)), silent = TRUE)

# model fitting using AD gradient
opt <- nlminb(obj$par, obj$fn, obj$gr)

# model summary
summary(sdreport(obj))[3:4,]
#>       Estimate Std. Error
#> loc   5.001543  0.2065935
#> scale 1.960676  0.1502500
```

Through the magic of `RTMB`, we can also immediately simulate new data
from the fitted model and calculate residuals:

``` r
# simulate new data
x_new <- obj$simulate()$x

# calculate residuals
osa <- oneStepPredict(obj, method = "cdf", trace = FALSE)
qqnorm(osa$res); abline(0, 1)
```
