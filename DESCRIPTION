Description: 
  The 'RTMBdist' package extends the functionality of the 'RTMB' package by providing a collection of non-standard probability distributions that are compatible with automatic differentiation (AD). 
  While 'RTMB' enables flexible and efficient modelling - including random effects - its built-in support is limited to standard distributions. 
  This package fills that gap by offering additional, AD-compatible distributions, broadening the range of models that can be implemented and estimated using 'RTMB'.
