Description: 
  Extends the functionality of the 'RTMB' package by providing a collection of non-standard probability distributions compatible with automatic differentiation (AD). 
  While 'RTMB' enables flexible and efficient modelling, including random effects, its built-in support is limited to standard distributions. 
  The package adds additional AD-compatible distributions, broadening the range of models that can be implemented and estimated using 'RTMB'.
