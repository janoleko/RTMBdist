Description: 
  Extends the functionality of the 'RTMB' <https://kaskr.r-universe.dev/RTMB> package by providing a collection of non-standard probability distributions compatible with automatic differentiation (AD). While 'RTMB' enables flexible and efficient modelling, including random effects, its built-in support is limited to standard distributions. The package adds additional AD-compatible distributions, broadening the range of models that can be implemented and estimated using 'RTMB'. Automatic differentiation and Laplace approximation are described in Kristensen et al. (2016) <doi:10.18637/jss.v070.i05>.
